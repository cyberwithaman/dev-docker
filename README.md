Here's a cleanly **organized and well-formatted version** of your `README.md` for your full Docker-based dev environment:

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Docker & Docker Compose

* Download and install: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* Verify installation:

  ```bash
  docker -v
  docker-compose -v
  ```

---

### 2. Start All Services

Run this command to start everything in the background:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait a few moments for all containers to start.

---

### 3. Access the Web UI Index
All tools and services can be accessed from a single place:

👉 Web UI Index: http://localhost:8888

This page lists links to the web interfaces for pgAdmin, phpMyAdmin, Mongo Express, Appwrite, Supabase Studio, and more.

---

## 📦 Stopping Services

To stop all services without deleting volumes:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## 🛠 Notes

* You can edit the HTML files in the `apache/` and `nginx/` folders to customize your web server homepages.
* Adminer allows quick access to SQLite and other DBs but may have limited support for Oracle unless configured properly.
* All services are containerized and isolated, making this ideal for local full-stack development.

**Happy Coding! 🎉**

Let me know if you'd like me to generate the actual `access-web-interfaces.html` file or customize further.
